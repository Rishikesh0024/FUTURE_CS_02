 SOC Internship Task – Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response

 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a beginner-level **Security Operations Center (SOC)** workflow involving **security alert monitoring, threat analysis, and incident response simulation** using **Splunk SIEM**.
The goal of this task is to understand how SOC teams analyze logs, detect malicious activity, prioritize alerts, and respond to security incidents.

 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Splunk (SIEM)
- Sample Security Logs
- Incident Response Documentation

---

#📂 Log Data
The dataset includes simulated security events such as:
- Login success & failed attempts
- Connection attempts
- Malware detections (Trojan, Rootkit, Spyware, Worm, Ransomware)
- File access activities

---

🔍 Analysis Performed
- Log ingestion and field extraction in Splunk
- Identification of malware-infected systems
- Detection of suspicious IP addresses
- Analysis of authentication anomalies
- Correlation of malware events with file access
- Alert severity classification

---

 🚨 Alert Severity Classification
- **Critical:** Ransomware behavior, Rootkit signature, Malware with file access
- **High:** Trojan, Worm, Spyware detections
- **Medium:** Multiple failed login attempts
- **Low:** Normal login activity

---

## 🛡 Incident Response (Simulated)
- Isolated affected systems
- Blocked malicious IP addresses
- Disabled compromised user accounts
- Initiated antivirus and endpoint scans

---

## 📄 Outcome
This project helped build foundational knowledge in:
- SOC alert monitoring
- SIEM-based threat detection
- Incident response workflow
- Security reporting & documentation
